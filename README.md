React: Employee Directory


## Description

Using React components and states, I created an employee directory that is able to respond to user events.

While there is oppurtunity for development, this MVP allows for the user to see a list of 25 users generated from [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). The users can be sorted into alphabetical order by clicking on the 'name' column heading. Then, using the search bar, the users will be narrowed down based on the entered characters.

This was accomplished by using a container to hold the state changes with the array of users and the input change functions that are passed to the search bar component.
